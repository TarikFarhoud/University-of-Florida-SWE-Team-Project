                <h1>Straws</h1>
                <p>Straws are primarily recycled into their byproducts of polypropylene (#5). Polypropylene is used to make pallets, bottles, jars, yogurt containers, hot beverage cups, and food packaging. Also, heavily used in the automotive industry to make batteries, bumpers, instrument panels, interior elements, and door trims. Straws are NOT biodegradable in nature by themselves, but instead break down into smaller plastics, called microplastics, which cause further environmental pollution and health problems. Use paper straws when you can!

                <h1>Single-Use Drinking/Juice Bottle</h1>
                <p>Recycling 1 ton of plastic bottles saves 7.4 cubic yards of space in landfill. Recycling 1 aluminum can is equivalent to 2.5 hours of TV with the energy saved. 2.5 million plastic bottles are thrown away every hour and it takes 450 years for each bottle to degrade by itself.
                    Main recyling byproduct is polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET from recycling is refactored into a lot of things, even like T-Shirts!

                <p>Styrofoam easily pollutes land and wind because of its lightweight nature allowing it to esily flow around. Wildlife even mistake styrofoam for food and ingest it. At its invention, Styrofoam was thought to be virtually safe for the environment, but researchers have found its degradation over time releases gases into the air called, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs have been linked to ozone layer degradation. Styrofoam's primary recycling byproduct is polystyrene (PS).</p>

                <p>Milk gallons are primarily recycled into their byproduct of high-density polyethylene. 47% of US Citizens find their milk gallons are difficult to recycle. This is due to its large size when compared to a small plastic bottle. The EPA has found that fewer than three out of ten high-density polyethylene milk jugs are recycled in the US. Unfortunately, US consumers are skeptical the milk jugs are even recycled and so put them in the garbage bin instead.  </p>
