# University-of-Florida-SWE-Team-Project
Team Project for University of Florida's CEN3031 Intro to Software Engineering


Our project is a website that allows users to track the plastics they recycle.
By submitting which plastic items a person has recycled, that user earns points which can be used to redeem rewards for their profile. Both systems - the earning of points and ability to redeem rewards - are meant to promote users to engage with the website and continuously recycle plastic goods for the betterment of the environment.
The website also features an information page which displays information about various plastic goods an individual may encounter and recycle in their day-to-day life, to better inform and allow users to know the exact benefits of their effort.
The points each user earns gives them a position on a leaderboard as well, to promote the competitive types to recycle as much as possible to score a top rank.
